PLG_CONTENT_SS="SuperSaaS Booking Plugin"
PLG_CONTENT_SS_DESCRIPTION="This plugin displays a 'Book now' button that automatically logs the user into a SuperSaaS schedule using his Joomla user name. It passes the user's information along, creating or updating the user's information on SuperSaaS as needed. This saves users from having to log in twice. Works with both the free and paid versions of SuperSaaS."
